 The website is used to track the many different leaugues in the professional Valorant scene.
 The website makes it very easy to follow teams throughout the season and it also have news on each team so
 it easy to keep track of when a player is dropped by and team.
 When looking at specific matches there are little forum underneath them that people in the community can talk about the match even before it starts.
 It also makes it very easy to track the brackets in tournaments and how they are progressing.

<p>
The reasons I like this website is because it makes it very easy for me to keep track of everything throughout the season.
It also makes it easy for me to track what teams a person played for in the past and what teams that are currently playing for.
Another reasons I like the site is because of its pickâ€™em system. 
The system is a way for people on the site to compete with one another to predict the outcome of matches and the overall outcome of tournaments.
