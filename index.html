<p>
 The website is used to track the many different leaugues in the professional Valorant scene. <br>
 The website makes it very easy to follow teams throughout the season and it also have news on each team so
 it easy to keep track of when a player is dropped by and team.<br>
 When looking at specific matches there are little forum underneath them that people in the community can talk about the match even before it starts. <br>
 It also makes it very easy to track the brackets in tournaments and how they are progressing.
